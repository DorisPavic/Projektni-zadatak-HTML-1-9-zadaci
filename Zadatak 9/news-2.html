            <p>With the lifting of the last, 165th segment of the steel span structure, the Pelješac bridge was
                completely connected on Thursday and it stretches from Komarna on the mainland, to Brijesta on Pelješac.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>The bridge has 13 spans, of which five main ones are 285 meters long, six centrally placed reinforced
                concrete pylons 33 meters high, and two lanes together with a stop lane that will serve to maintain the
                bridge. The last element that was installed tonight is 18 meters long, and the symbolic installation was
                completed by Prime Minister Andrej Plenković, Minister of Transport Oleg Butković, Dubrovnik-Neretva
                County Prefect Nikola Dobroslavić and President of the Croatian Roads Administration Josip Škorić. The
                connection was followed by numerous citizens from the mainland and many boats, barges and other vessels.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>The length of the bridge from the axis to the axis of the abutments is 2,404 meters, the total length of
                the bridge with abutments is 2,440 meters, and the navigation profile under the bridge is 200 times 55
                meters.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The main and responsible designer of the Pelješac Bridge is Marjan Pipenbaher. The bridge was built by
                the Chinese consortium China Road and Bridge Corporation. The Chinese got the job in a tender in 2018,
                offering 2.081 billion kuna without VAT, with a 36-month completion deadline.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The decision to finance the construction of the bridge was made by the Government in 2017. Construction
                officially began on July 31, 2018, when the contractor was introduced to the works. In May 2013, a study
                commissioned by the European Commission showed that the Peljesac Bridge was the best solution to connect
                southern Croatia with the rest of the country.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Peljesac Bridge is the first of a total of four phases of the "Road Connection with Southern
                Dalmatia" project, for which the European Commission has approved 357m euros in grants or 85 per cent of
                eligible costs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Namely, the total value of the project is 526 million euros including VAT, and the value of eligible
                costs is 420 million euros, of which 85 percent is co-financed by the European Union, ie 357 million
                euros. The European Union also finances supporting infrastructure: access roads, tunnels, additional
                bridges and viaducts, as well as the Ston bypass.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The bridge along with access roads is expected to be open to traffic in June 2022, before the start of
                the main tourist season.</p>
