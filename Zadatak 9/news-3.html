            <p>A large fire broke out at around 11 am on the island of Pelješac, east of the settlement of Lovište in
                the municipality of Orebić. It is burning on a very difficult terrain where there are currently 30
                firefighters from companies on Pelješac. As we have learned from the commander of DVD Orebić, Nikša
                Nogalo, the forest fire near Lovište has been
                brought under control, thanks to the quick intervention of firefighters. Firefighters from DVD Lovište,
                Orebić, Viganj, Trpanj and Kuna were taking part in the extinguishing.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the forest fire that broke out in the area of Vučipolje on the northeast side of Lovište, a little
                more than three hectares of macchia, grass and several olive trees were burned.

                The causes are still being determined, and firefighters from the Orebic and Loviste Voluntary Fire
                Brigades are still on duty at the fire, soaking the edges, and they will monitor it until the fire is
                declared extinguished.
            </p>

            <p>Thanks to the quick notification of the beginning of the fire and the intervention, the fire was brought
                under control at around 1 pm on Tuesday, thus preventing major material damage.

                On that occasion, the Fire Brigade again called on the population to exercise extreme caution, warning
                that in these hot days, and until November 1, it is strictly forbidden to light fires in the open.
            </p>
